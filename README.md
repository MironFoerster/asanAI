# TensorFlow.js Demonstrator

This is a more or less complete GUI for TensorFlow.js. With it, you can create and train models
fully in your browsers.

# Status

This is a very early alpha.

# Installation

## Apache2 + PHP

Nothing more is needed. TensorFlow.js does not need any server-Backend because it runs fully in
the browser. The only thing PHP is needed for is to download the datasets for the default networks
offers. Everything else is just HTML/CSS/JS.
